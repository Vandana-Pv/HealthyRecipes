# HealthyRecipes Google Action 

Healthy Recipes is an action where the assistant recommends the healthy alternative of the item asked by the user. For an example, when the user asks for a Chocolate Milkshake, the Assistant suggests the user whether the user would like to hear it and moves further based on the answer given by the user.

## Architecture

The action consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end. The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the **Dialogflow**. The back end is where the logic of the action resides.
